The [Electrolyzer] is a machine which uses the electrolysis process to split a fluid into two different ones. 
It can split water into hydrogen and oxygen and brine into chlorine and hydrogen. 
It requires electricity to operate. 
To form the block, use a hammer on the heavy engineering block in front of the machine.

The fluid has to be provided to the side of the machine, after the process is finishes the two created fluids 
will be outputted to the front. Although the machine's internal tanks allow storing small amount of the 
liquid, consider construction of [proper tank](tank) for an industrial-scale electrolysis.
