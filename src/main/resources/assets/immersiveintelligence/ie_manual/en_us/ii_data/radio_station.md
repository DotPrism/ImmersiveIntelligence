The Radio Station is a device for sending and receiving data wirelessly. Radio stations sends packets to other towers in range (100 block, less in bad weather) that shares the frequency of the sending tower.

The Radio Station is an advanced multiblock, which means it can be only built using an Electric Engineer's Hammer in a 2-step process. 

In the first stage the multiblock must be built and then a hammer has to be used on the upper advanced electronic engineering block
In the second, energy (trough using the electric hammer) has to be provided to finish it.

# 2
The Radio Station's frequency can be set by using a Radio Tuner, and can be checked by sneak right-clicking.

There are 2 versions of the tuner with different ranges of frequencies. 

The radio station by default can use only the basic range.
